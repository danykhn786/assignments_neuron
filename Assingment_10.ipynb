    "**Answer:** 'send2trash' is a third-party module that provides a safer way to delete files and directories. Instead of permanently deleting a file, it moves it to the trash/recycle bin of the operating system, allowing the user to recover it if needed. <br>\n",
    "'shutil' modules on the other hand deletes the files permanently. We can use 'shutil.rmtree()' to delete the files and it not possible to recover once deleted."
