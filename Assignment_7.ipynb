    "**2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?**<br>\n",
    "**Answer:** Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped. Raw Strings are often used in regular expression objects to prevent escape characters from being interpreted as escape sequences by the Python interpreter. Instead, the raw string literal is passed directly to the regular expression engine, which can then use the escape characters as literal characters in pattern."

    "**Answer:** We can use the 'group()' method of a 're.match' object to extract actual strings that match the pattern. The 'group()' method takes index as argument and returns the string that corresponds to the capturing with the given index in the pattern. IF the pattern contains multiple capturing groups, we can use the 'groups()' method to get a tuple containing all of the captured strings, in the order in which the groups appear in the pattern.
